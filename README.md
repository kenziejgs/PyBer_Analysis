# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the usage of PyBer, a ride-sharing app, across the country, specifically focusing on the differences in utilization between urban, suburban and rural communities.

### Resources
Data Sources: [Ride Data CSV](Resources/ride_data.csv) & [City Data CSV](Resources/city_data.csv)
Software: Python 3.9.12, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib

### Results
After merging the two datasets into a single dataframe, I was able to calculate the total number of drivers, number of rides and total fares broken down by the type of city. I then calculated the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver as well. This information can be seen here:
